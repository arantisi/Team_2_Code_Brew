Layered System is a REST constraint that states that a RESTFUL system can be composed of multiple layers. You can have a layer that adds security, a layer that stores data and a layer to authenticate requests, for example. The layers may be on different servers. These layers are invisible to the client. A client cannot ordinarily tell whether it is connected directly to the end server or an intermediary along the way.
